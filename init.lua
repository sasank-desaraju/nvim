-- NOTE: Throughout this config, some plugins are

-- them around as examples.
-- You can enable them by changing `enabled = false`
-- to `enabled = true` in the respective plugin spec.
-- Some of these also have the
-- PERF: (performance) comment, which
-- indicates that I found them to slow down the config.
